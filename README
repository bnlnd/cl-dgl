dgl: CFFI core OpenGL binding generator

Not Lisp-friendly. Be prepared to :use CFFI.
I wanted bindings as close to the C API as possible, as they look in online
documentation and tutorials. Names aren't "lispified" except to replace the
GL prefix with a Lisp package.

GL_ENUM_NAME => GL:ENUM_NAME
glFunctionName => GL:FUNCTIONNAME

Each function grabs its pointer on its first invocation.
Bind DGL:*ADDRESS-FUNCTION* to your flavor of #'getProcAddress before using.
(That's a Lisp function, not a pointer.)

Regenerate the bindings with (DGL:MAKE-GL).

A few stupid OpenGL programs can be found in test/. Run with asdf:test-system.
